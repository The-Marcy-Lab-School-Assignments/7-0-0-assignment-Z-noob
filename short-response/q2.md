# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer
The `useState` hook in React returns an array with exactly two elements, the current state value and the state setter function. The current value is initialized with the a call like `useState(initialValue)`. React will re-render the component with the updated state, when the setter function is called with  the new state value like `setState(newValue)`.

A full example is like `useState(null)` returns an array `[state, setState]`
