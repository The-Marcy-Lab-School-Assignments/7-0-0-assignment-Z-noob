# Question

What happens when the setter function returned by `useState` is invoked?

# Answer
When the setter function invoked, the state is updated with the new value or new value based on the previous state. And React schedules a re-render of the component with the new state value in an efficient way by using its reconciliation algorithm to update only the parts of the DOM that have changed. It batch update if multiple state updates, and applies them asynchronously to ensure the component is only re-rendered once.
